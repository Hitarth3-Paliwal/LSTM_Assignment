# LSTM_Assignment
To identify and implement research papers related to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks for forecasting, sequence prediction, and sequence classification tasks. You will replicate experiments, validate results, and discuss the findings based on the chosen papers.

## Experiment 5.1: 
### Objective:
To forecast future values of a univariate time series using LSTM-based models.

## Experiment 5.2: Sequence Text Prediction using LSTM
### Objective:
To generate next characters/words based on a given input sequence using LSTM.

## Experiment 5.3: Sequence Text Classification using LSTM
### Objective:
To classify text sequences using LSTM-based models (e.g., sentiment or spam detection).
